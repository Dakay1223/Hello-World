# Hello-World
A test repository
I am using this project in order to get reacquainted with programming, algorithms and computer science in general. It has been over six years since I have coded anything seriously. Six year. It sounds so long when it is stated like that. I can have excuses. I commissioned in the Army. I got married. I gained and lost friends. I lived life. But now...I want to get back into it. I want to use these muscles that have atrophied. Relearn what I once knew, and hopefully do something more closely aligned to it. The truth is I have been lazy. I thought my talents and skills would be obvious to all that saw me. What I learned is that everyone only wants to know what you can do for them. It doesn't matter if you know how to elgantly code a beautiful algorithm, if you can't fill a radio. So I focused my energy on that. Doing what my superiors wanted and I grew soft in my skills. Let this be the first set. Let this be the beginning of my journey from the wilderness. Let this be the first thinging I do in order to be a computer scientist again.
